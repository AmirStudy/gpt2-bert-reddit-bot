for the past 8-10 years. [SEP] Don't be lazy about it but if you feel really good about yourself, and want to feel better, work on it. Work on all of your goals, and put everything aside. You know, that one or more of the goals of the past 8-10 years were so good it changed our lives forever. <|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>If you want to be rich, write:  [SEP] The most important thing for someone who wants to get rich is to have a plan, not just a list. <|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>I feel bad about the comment. You're a genius in one form or another with the power to make anyone else feel better. You're also a really, really smart fellow with a knack for understanding the world at large. The world as it exists is a complex, interconnected system. What are your best ways to solve or reduce this? Or instead of solving this, how can you think of any solution, and even if you somehow manage to find it, how do you justify any action to people in this universe (or any other)? What do you expect people to understand for the most part? When people are willing to do something that isn't going to make them feel better, that's not only a plus, it's a benefit on an equal footing.  [SEP] I find it's the same thing that makes it hard, but a bit more difficult. You may never achieve immortality, but if you're willing to change, you're willing to live. It doesn�t matter if you die, or whether you get a better place in time. \n","\n","In the end, the goal here isn't immortality. The goal is to change the entire universe, and only change to do that, the world's laws, the cosmos. That's the goal. \n","\n","And to make the best of it all, you have to remember that the universe is finite - how much space-time we live in, the amount of time needed to change it, to get from here to there, the change has to come at an end - the universe can never be infinite or infinite if the universe is the same, if the universe does not have finite parts. [SEP] Not that I'm suggesting you write it in a more elegant sentence. <|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>When I had my eyes closed, I felt just as though I was in the middle of the lake and was sitting on a boat, with a man's shoulder resting on my lap and a smile on my face. It also worked nicely with the dark night vision in the glasses he was wearing. When I thought about that, I realized that I was holding my own hand in the darkness; I was holding the world. When I turned the darkness toward the shore, I saw a small, white island; it was about 10-15 minutes away from me, and I could barely feel my hands. That's when I decided I knew I needed to see him and my eyes closed again. [SEP] No, actually, I think you need to read some more to get out the \"what if\" part. That's a plot flaw in your story that you should solve instead. <|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>My son, who I adopted from the foster care system, is 4 years old. He was a great boy and a natural athlete. We put him up in a home where his peers have to learn to behave like they're supposed to, or you just get a crappy life. I hope he stays out, because my experience showed him no positive life-signs.\n","\n","The other person who was on the system is his brother from school. He was never like his older brother. He was like a tomboy. He said he would go through school to become a professional athlete, but to me, he was just getting used to being a teen and was still learning. The day I told him I was in the system he didn't take the picture because I couldn't understand in a word what he meant by it. And that was another week.\n","\n","He went to another foster home and another family, because she had to leave and because her parents had lost it all together. But no more.\n","\n","My grandson was 6 years old and he still had a lot of room to grow. I thought at 4-years old he had room to compete with other kids that he saw everywhere.\n","\n","To be honest, I hate seeing all the other kids like my son, because when you get to age 6 or 7, these kids are going through the same things the foster kids did.

The reason you don't do this is because it is going to hurt your readers. Because they need to feel like someone cares about their work, the easiest way to do that is to avoid using \"love\" altogether, but you could try it with \"I like\" a lot, and have your characters say, \"I like to write love-filled scenes\". But it might sound weird, and hard to say, or not that it's \"love\", even if you know how the word describes love. \n","\n","I know that a lot of writers out there don't use \"love\" at all, but I can assure you that that is a totally normal thing, because it's like using the words \"love\" in writing to describe love, or being afraid of the word \"love\" at all. What you're trying to do is take \"love\" and make it as generic as possible in order to make the word \"love\" less appealing. The reason \"love\" is often used as something else is that it is meant to evoke the meaning a lot of people get by using \"love\". To try to change that by using those words is usually what makes it hard for a lot of writers to do. \n","\n","So, just be careful about it and just learn how to get good at it.

The easiest way to do that is not to use those words, because some people are going to hear them and take them literally.\n","\n","Instead, write some love that reflects and expresses the meaning that you are trying to convey. \n","\n","Try to avoid using \"love\" because the word \"love\" is the wrong term for it, it's a generic word for love. I mean that as a compliment, but not as a criticism, and not to give my characters more \"sneak-a-shot-at-me-all-the-time-so-I-can-talk-funny-words-at-my-dinner-party\" qualities.\n","\n","Instead (I know I'm saying \"easy\" advice, sorry), use \"love.\" The word just means \"love\" and has meaning, which you don't share in real life.\n","\n","Try different words, and find something that fits your story better. You can experiment with different word choice and spellings. Experiment with words that you don't use often. Try different words to make characters who are really great at something feel like they are just \"good at it\" by using them as a form of praise. \n","\n","\"He can talk the talk and walk the walk\" is an example. A lot of writers try to use that. It's hard, because they need to keep the story grounded in reality, and it isn't going to work if they just use words.\n","\n","And \"love\" is actually all that a lot of writers use, in real life.\n","\n","My best advice for writing a love story that I feel people should care about is to have them be as generic as possible. My biggest question is this: is it a bad thing? \n","\n","I mean, it's going to hurt my readers, but how badly do I want them to feel the love I'm using for my characters?\n","\n","I am asking here because I'm doing this too, I don't do this, \"no\" just means \"I don't\", \"yes\" can mean \"I did\".  \n","\n","If you're a writer, it's not wrong, the most common advice to writers is to just use the generic word \"love\".  \"It's the easiest word in the English language to use\" is also a common answer I see from people who know they can't do it.\n","\n","But you can do the same thing with, \"I love to write love-filled scenes\". Or \"I love a character who loves love scenes\". \"I love love\" can be another way to add insult to injury.\n","\n","All of which I mean, by not using \"love\" to make your characters' relationships with other people as \"love\" makes them less appealing to readers, it makes them less \"real\" people.
